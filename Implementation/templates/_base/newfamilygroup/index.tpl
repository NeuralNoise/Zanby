		This allows  groups of people that share an interest to join together to pursue a common agenda.  It also enables organizations to manage many groups simultaneously.    
		
		Anyone can start a group family and then invite groups to join.  Each group in the family will retain its original structure, while a new structure will be created that can be used to manage the activities and business of the linked groups!{/t}
